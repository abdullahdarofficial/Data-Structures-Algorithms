"""
Time Complexity for BFS-based Spanning Tree
Best Case, Average Case, Worst Case: 
 
O(V+E)
Explanation: Each vertex and edge is processed once. Traversing all vertices and their adjacent edges takes 
 
O(V+E), which is optimal for a graph traversal algorithm.
Space Complexity: 

O(V+E)
This is due to the visited, parent arrays (O(V)) and the graph adjacency list (O(E)).
