# -------------------------------
# Time complexity analysis:
# -------------------------------

# 1. Initializing the distances dictionary:
#    - Time complexity: O(V), where V is the number of vertices.
#    - We initialize the distance for each vertex to infinity, except for the source vertex.

# 2. Main loop (processing the priority queue):
#    - Time complexity: O((V + E) log V), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.
#    - We process each vertex and edge once. Each pop and push operation on the priority queue takes O(log V).
#    - In total, there will be O(E) edge relaxations and O(V) pop operations from the priority queue,
#      each of which takes O(log V) time.

# 3. Updating distances:
#    - Time complexity: O(E), where E is the number of edges.
#    - We update the distance for each edge in the graph.

# Overall time complexity:
# - Best-case time complexity: O((V + E) log V), as we process each vertex and edge.
# - Average-case time complexity: O((V + E) log V).
# - Worst-case time complexity: O((V + E) log V), since Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm processes every edge and vertex.

# Space complexity:
# - Space complexity: O(V), where V is the number of vertices.
# - This includes the space for the distances dictionary and the priority queue.
